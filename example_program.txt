;  This is a simple program which takes in the timer , temperature, spin speed info and wash type info and executes 
;  the wash cycle for a given amount of time as present in the timer info. 
;  NOTE -
; TIM, TMP, SPS, WAT are subroutines which have specific executions

START
BSA TIM; **Time for which we want to execute**
BSA TMP; **Temperature control**
BSA SPS ; **Spin speed**
BSA WAT ; **Wash type**

LDA TIME I
CMA
INC
; Loop to execute Washing of clothes
SPN   ; start spinning of the motor
LOP, INC
     SZA 
     BUN LOP
HLT   ; halt the motor

INC   ; AC is incremented and is now 1
STA WASH I ; store AC's value in the memory location which specifies  that  our ; machine is draining ( drain - 1, wash - 0)
CLA ; clearing AC
STA TIME I ; storing 0 in timer and temperature as we are only draining now
STA TEMP I
ICL ; inlet valve is cleared(means valve closed), no more water required
OST ; outlet valve is set(means outlet valve opened), water to be flushed
DRN ; drain the water present in the machine

; The below loop corresponds to the fact that our clothes need to be dried after ; the draining operation and thus they are dried for a CLEAN amount of time.

LDA CLEAN ; loading CLEAN which is the amount of time for which we would drain our machine always
CMA ; complement and incrementing so that negative value used as counter
INC 
SPN ; start the spinning of the motor
REP,  INC
      SZA
      BUN REP
HLT ; halt the motor
STA WASH I; AC is stored in the wash type and spin speed (AC is actually zero ;and thus they are set to default)
STA SPEED I
