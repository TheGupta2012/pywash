;  This is a simple program which takes in the timer , temperature, spin speed info and wash type info and executes 
;  the wash cycle for a given amount of time as present in the timer info. 
;  NOTE -
> TIM, TMP, SPS, WAT are subroutines which hasve specific executiosns and we will define them later.
> The length of the words is NOT THREE LETTER right now as this is just for illustration purposes.
> Specifications of Status signals is not mentioned right now.

START
BSA TIM; **Time for which we want to execute**
BSA TMP; **Temperature control**
BSA SPS ; **Spin speed**
BSA WAT ; **Wash type**

LDA TIME I
CMA
INC
; Loop to execute Washing of clothes
LOP, INC
     SPIN ; Not sure right now what to include here but yes, this is what is going to happen in this loop
     SZA 
     BUN LOP
     
INC   ; AC is incremented and is now 1
STA WASHType I ; store AC's value in the memory location which specifies whether our machine is washing or draining ( drain - 1, wash - 0)
CLA ; clearing AC
STA TIME I ; storing 0 in timer and temperature info as we are only draining now
STA TEMP I
ICL ; inlet valve is cleared(means valve closed), no more water required
OST ; outlet valve is set(means outlet valve opened), water to be flushed
DRN ; Not sure right now what to implement here
LDA CLEAN I ; loading CLN which is the constant amount of time for which we would drain our machine always
CMA ; complement and incrementing so that negative value used as counter
INC

; The below loop corresponds to the fact that our clothes need to be dried after the draining operation and thus they are dried for a CLEAN 
; amount of time.
REP,  INC
      SPN ; Not sure right now
      SZA
      BUN REP
STA WASHType I; AC is stored in the wash type and spin speed (AC is actually zero and thus they are set to default)
STA SPEED I
STOP
